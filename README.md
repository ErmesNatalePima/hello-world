You ever feel like you’ve got a special power? Nah, not a cool one like flying or invisibility. I’m talking about the power to curse whatever line or lane I choose. Every. Single. Time. The second I switch, the line I just left turns into the freaking Indy 500, and the new one? Slow-motion disaster.

And of course, you glance back at your old spot, and what do you see? People zooming past with that smug look like they just won the lottery. Meanwhile, I’m standing there, trying not to lose my mind for falling for it AGAIN.

Traffic? Even worse. My lane is a parking lot. I switch over, and BOOM, instant gridlock. And the lane I was in? Autobahn mode.

The worst part? I NEVER learn. Every time, I’m like “this time, I’m making the right call.” Spoiler alert: no, I’m not. Ever. So if you ever see me in a line or a lane? Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away. I don’t need to drag you down with me.
